## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
This final project showcases my previous work, including Seatwork 2, Hands-on 1, Seatwork 3, Hands-on 2, and Seatwork 4. It highlights my experiences in coding HTML, troubleshooting, and using commit messages, as well as my design journey throughout the IT0043 course.

The website features unique designs, navigations, headers, and content such as resumes, repository links, deployment links to my past projects, images of the languages used, and the total time spent coding each project. Additionally, it incorporates card-like styles and feature styles. The website was built using HTML for structure and CSS for styling and color.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
